## Experimental Design
* I used tweepy to mine tweets and scored the tweets using VADER 
* To generate insights, I applied Matplotlib, Seaborn and WordCloud. 
* Applied Natural Language Processing objects in text processing
* Modelled using TensorFlow. The sentiment analysis model attained an accuracy of 75%.
